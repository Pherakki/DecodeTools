The tool is unable to reproduce KCAP files with 100% accuracy for several reasons, 
the main one the files being inconsistent in the first place.

This document is intended to list all known inaccuracies, their severity and how to deal with them.

=====
Name: GMIO data alignment
Description: In some rare cases GMIO data is not properly aligned to 0x80
Severity: Minor
Handling: The flaw has no noticeable effects. Reading works flawlessly, re-exported files will be aligned properly.

=====
Name: life01.res/life02.res format
Description: The maps life01 and life02 are using and old version of the KCAP format (probably from Re:Digitize), 
             that is following different rules.
Severity: Minor
Handling: Re-Export both maps to convert them.

=====
Name: ETC1 re-export
Description: When exported ETC1 and ETC1A4 textures will not match up byte perfectly with the input data.
             This is because ETC1 is a compressed format and the re-compression simply produces a different result.
Severity: Very Minor
Handling: It's unavoidable and can be neglected 

=====
Name: Irregular MipMaps
Description: Some files have textures with MipMaps for Human characters, without there being any indication in the
             corresponding GMIO. They also don't seem to be used (by Citra), so they may be a left-over.
Severity: Minor
Handling: The affected files should be re-exported to remove the MipMaps.
          Use the dedicated Tools -> Re-Export malformatted files function.
