The tool is unable to reproduce KCAP files with 100% accuracy for several reasons, 
the main one the files being inconsistent in the first place.

This document is intended to list all known inaccuracies, their severity and how to deal with them.

=====
Name: GMIO data alignment
Description: In some rare cases GMIO data is not properly aligned to 0x80
Severity: Minor
Handling: The flaw has no noticeable effects. Reading works flawlessly, re-exported files will be aligned properly.

=====
Name: life01.res/life02.res format
Description: The maps life01 and life02 are using and old version of the KCAP format (probably from Re:Digitize), 
             that is following different rules. The new KCAP implementation does not support those rules.
Severity: Moderate
Handling: Re-Export both maps with the old KCAP implementation, to convert them.
Proper fix: change new KCAP implementation to support the life files, by reading the headerSize field?

=====
Name: ETC1 re-export
Description: When exported ETC1 and ETC1A4 textures will not match up byte perfectly with the input data.
             This is because ETC1 is a compressed format and the re-compression simply produces a different result.
Severity: Very Minor
Handling: It's unavoidable and can be neglected 

=====
Name: Irregular MipMaps
Description: Some files have textures with MipMaps for Human characters, without there being any indication in the
             corresponding GMIO. They also don't seem to be used (by Citra), so they may be a left-over.
Severity: Moderate
Handling: The affected files need to be re-exported to remove the MipMaps in order for ARCV rebuilds to succeed.
          Use the dedicated Tools -> Re-Export malformatted files function.
